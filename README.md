StateMachine
C# StateMachine that is Class Based (State) with the typical Enter/Exit/Update/FixedUpdate Methods, but each state also has a transition event that can be subscribed to. This allows not only the creation of new states, but other code to attach it's own methods to be executed on the various state changes.
